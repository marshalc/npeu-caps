Prototype data collection form for the Cardiac Arrest in Pregnancy Study (CAPS) created as part of a submission
for interview as a programmer/database manager in the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU).

Notes:

This shortened form does not include the anticipated due date, so we can not add extra functionality to allow data to be
entered and then have the system contact the creator again two weeks after the expected due date to complete.

Without further consultation with the principle investigator, it is not trivial to decide on how to handle the
ambiguities created by this supplied form. For example, the instructions ask for the creator to indicate in a later
section if they do not know any of the answers, however, that section is not part of this task. There are several
instances where questions are framed and it is unclear as to whether the answer is optional, compulsory, and how or if
we should record "Unknown" results compared to "Unanswered" data.
